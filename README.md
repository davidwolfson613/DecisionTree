# DecisionTree
This is a cool school project I worked on. I created decision tree classifiers from scratch. The Decision tree classifier was then scaled up to create a Random Forest classifier to obtain better classification accuracy. This repo contains the source code for the decision tree and random forest classifiers, and a file containing several unit tests that ensure the code was written correctly.

# How to run locally
This repo can be cloned locally and run by typing this command into the command line:

    python decision_tree.py
